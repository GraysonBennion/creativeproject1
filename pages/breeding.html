      <h1>Why You Should Care About Your Pokemon's Parents </h1>
      <p>IVs or Individual Values, are what constitutes your Pokemon's genetics.
	Some Pokemon are born stronger than others, plain and simple. There
	might be two caterpies that have lived the exact same life, they have
	the same natures and number of EVs, but one will always be faster than
	the other. This would be because the faster caterpie has a higher number
	of IVs in it's speed stat.</p>
      <img src="../photos/caterpie.png" width="400px">
      <p>A Pokemon can have 31 IVs in a given stat which are added to the
	"baseline" for the species. In other words a Pokemon with all 0's for
	IV's is the worst of it's kind and a Pokemon with 31's for IV's is the
	best of it's kind (at least for battling).</p>
      <p>To prevent you from having to go out and catch 600 Caterpies in the
	hopes that you will find one with perfect IV's, the game provides a
	method to pass on IV's from parents to children in the from of breeding.
	The daycare center does a lot more than just allow your Pokemon to gain
	levels, it also allows you to create very powerful Pokemon.</p>
      <p>Depending on which game you are in there are unique ways to do this,
	but across the board you are able to pass on good stats the children of
	parent Pokemon. As a rule, when two Pokemon breed, the baby will always
	belong to the mother's species. This means that it isn't important and
	much which species the father is, as long as the two parents are from
	compatible egg groups (there information can be found online).</p>
      <p>Basically what you need to remember is that if you have a male
	Charizard with high Attack IVs, and a female Charizard with high HP
	IVs then there are special items you can give them to hold in the
	daycare so that they will pass on those stats to the baby Chamander.</p>
      <p>Happy Breeding!</p>
