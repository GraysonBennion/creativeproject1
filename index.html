      <h1>Welcome to The World of (Competitive) Pokemon!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the website, thanks for visiting! My hope is that this
	site can be a valuable resource for those people wishing to know
	more about how to play the Pokemon video games in the competitive
	sphere.</p>
      <img src="photos/playpokemon.png" width="300px">

      <p>As an introduction for those who aren't aware, there are many numbers
	and algorithms involved when calculating stats for different pokemon.
	There are methods in the games to manipulate these numbers to get the
	best result for the Pokemon you want to battle with. Imagine you have an
	Alakazam and you want it to be really powerful at using the attack
	"Psychic". As a general rule, Alakazam's have a very high special attack
	stat, which is great because that will affect Psychic's Power.</p>
      <img src="photos/alakazam.png" width="300px">

      <p>There's a lot to talk about in competitive Pokemon, but for now
	I will only talk about how to maniuplate a Pokemon's stats for the
	greatest effect. In the example of Alakazam, depending on some factors,
	your level 100 Alakazam could have a special attack stat of anywhere
	from 247 all the way to 336, almost 100 points higher! The techniques
	you can learn from this website will help you to create the type of
	Pokemon that YOU want to battle with. Maybe you don't want an attacking
	Alakazam as much as a defensive one? We can help you do that.</p>
      
      <p>Every Pokemon species has a "baseline" stat spread. This just means
	that certain species are better are certain things. Alakazams all have
	naturally higher speed and special attack, for example. Beyond that
	there are only a handful of other elements that make up a particular
	Pokemon's stats. Some I won't be talking about are held items and
	abilities, but these speak for themselves for the most part in the
	games. What the games don't tell you about are EV's, IV's (explained in
	the breeding section) and Natures.
